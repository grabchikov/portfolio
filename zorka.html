          Zorka reached out to me to redesign their main project management
          tool. They wanted to make it more user friendly and improve employee
          productivity, and give the tool a better look and feel. It turned out
          to an awesome story of collaboration that lead to a full redesign of
          the product, and complete revision of their working process.

              underlying challenges. I wanted to know about the improvements

              I got 18 responses that gave me the detailed understanding of the

          requested this payment to the clients this employee works with to the

            The operational performance is to be improved. Together with the
            team we found out that blogger search function, campaign management,
            and some other functions could be completely redesigned and
            improved. It was intended to save employee time and money for the
            company

          Platform is the product where employee spend their significant part of
          workday. 61% of the employee said that they spend more than 3 hours
          per day, another 22,2% said they spend more then 6 hours per day.

          The research showed how time consuming working with the platform is
          and how important it is to optimize it. Google Forms

        <p>
          From the research, I realized that optimizing the influence managers’
          routine leads not only to cutting the corporate spendings on routine
          tasks, but also to more employee satisfaction.
