          Zorka reached out to me to redesign their main project management
          tool. They wanted to make it more user friendly and improve employee
          productivity, and give the tool a better look and feel. It turned out
          to an awesome story of collaboration that lead to a full redesign of
          the product, and complete revision of their working process.

              underlying challenges. I wanted to know about the improvements

              I got 18 responses that gave me the detailed understanding of the

          requested this payment to the clients this employee works with to the

              Influence managers used to work with lists of influencers outside
              of the platform. Mostly they used Excel and Google Spreadsheet
              because it is a powerful and handy tool. Building an alternative
              to these industry standard tools could be challenging, so we
              decided to develop an extensive import-export functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now managers can operate the tools they are used to, and, on the
              other hand, keep campaign and blogger database up-to-date.A common
              use case was searching the bloggers on Youtube and then adding to
              the mailing lists or on the other stages of campaign. That’s why
              we implemented import by link to the profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now user can import an influencer channel by copy and pasting link
              to the channel. It will instantly add the influencer to the
              database, pull all the necessary information from third party
              sources and add the influencer to the campaign. Also, they used
              spreadsheets for communication with their clients, so it was
              important to implement export feature as well.

          scratch even though the content of these emails was the same for the
          most cases (like invitation to join the campaign, help instructions on
          posting the video, or invoice request). Some managers had their own
          set of templates that they copied from their Google Docs.

        <h2>Addressing the challenge</h2>
        <p>
          As a way to improve the communication, I suggested integration with
          Intercom system. This allowed the team to use a previously created set
          of templates for typical communication cases. No need in typing the
          same texts every time, copy-pasting templates. Instead there is a
          centralized repository of reusable templates.

            <p>
              Because Influence Managers used Gmail as their main communication
              tool, the communication was not transparent. It was hard for
              another manager to pick the conversation if needed (for example,
              in case of sick leave).
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s why it was important to provide maximum transparency by
              showing communication status on the platform (with the help of
              Intercom API). With its help all team members can see if the
              influencer was contacted, if he or she opened or replied the
              email.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides, of course all the messages are transparent within
              Intercom system and team lead or another manager can pick the
              conversation up in case of emergency.
