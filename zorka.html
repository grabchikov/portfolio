          <p class="flex-item-50">
            Zorka reached out to me to redesign their main project management
            tool. They wanted to make it more user friendly and improve employee
            productivity, and give the tool a better look and feel. It turned
            out to an awesome story of collaboration that lead to a full
            redesign of the product, and complete revision of their working
            process.
